# TypeScript Compiler

## Table of contents

# Using Watch Mode

```tsx
tsc app.ts --watch
```

# Compiling the Entire Project

Running this code at the root of the folder will generate a `tsconfig.json` with a bunch of configurations:

```tsx
tsc --init
```

After that if we run `tsc` at the root of the project it will run the compiler over all ts files inside the project

```tsx
tsc --watch
```

# Including & Excluding files

```tsx

```
